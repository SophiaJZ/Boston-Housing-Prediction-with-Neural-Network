These projects aim to make predictions for various case studies using machine learning models such as Neural Networks, RandomForestRegressor, and RandomForestClassifier. The analysis was conducted based on the structure and type of the dataset. Factors like the number of target variables to be predicted played an important role in selecting the appropriate machine learning model. To evaluate the performance of the models, I used different evaluation metrics, including MSE, MAE, Precision, Recall, F1-score, Accuracy, and the ROC Curve.
